This is the first task provided to me during my internship at CodeAlpha. 
It is Basic Network Sniffer that can catch various addresses. 
This program can capture, IP, TCP and UDP addresses. 
It is important to note that you should have python installed in your setup.
Afterwards, you should install scapy library by running the Command Promt as Adminsistrator and typing "pip install scapy".
In order to capture packets and perform network analysis for the Win32 platforms, we then install WinPcap.
